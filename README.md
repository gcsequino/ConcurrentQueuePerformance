# ConcurrentQueuePerformance

## Application and Platform
This project will investigate the performance of a blocking concurrent queue versus the performance of a non-blocking concurrent queue for mulitple producer, multiple consumer enviornments. Queues are used extensively in multithreaded enviornments to pass messages or data between threads. Performance of these queues is a critical consideration. For example, a queue that locks when waiting on a single slow thread will degrade the performance of the entire system. These queue data structures are going to be implemented in C++ and designed to run in any parallel multiple consumer, multiple producer enviornment.
